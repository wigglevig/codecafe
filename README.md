## Operational Transformation

CodeCafé uses a custom OT implementation on both the client and server to keep all participants’ views of a document consistent.

OT enables:

- Adjusting operations (insert/delete) when concurrent changes occur  
- Ensuring all clients converge to the same document state  
- Preserving each user’s intended edits  

The system handles:

- Concurrent edits from multiple users  
- Deterministic conflict resolution  
- Consistent document state across sessions  

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a GitHub Actions pipeline with:

- **Continuous Integration:** Tests for client and server on each PR and push  
- **Continuous Deployment:** Automatic deployment to EC2 (server) and Vercel (client) on merges to `main`  
- **Quality Checks:** Basic safeguards against regressions before deployment
